<p>A <a class="def" name="contributor" id="contributor">Contributor</a> is a Participant who has signed the

<p>If a Contributor&#8217;s employment situation changes such that

<p>An <span class="def"><a class="ref" href="#openjdk-member">OpenJDK Member</a></span> is a Contributor who
has demonstrated a history of significant contributions to the

An OpenJDK Member may propose new Groups, may lead a Group, and is
eligible to vote on new <a class="ref" href="#project">Projects</a>, new OpenJDK Members, and the selection of

<div class="body">
<p>Many of the actions defined in these Bylaws are approved or
ratified by a group of individuals using one of the following
voting methods.</p>
<p>For all of the methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Votes take place over a period of two weeks, unless otherwise
specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voters may change their votes at any time during a voting
period. Only a voter&#8217;s most recent vote is counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individuals participating in a vote must act in good
faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual who proposes an action must respond in a timely
fashion to all questions and objections raised during the voting
period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except where noted, all votes are to be conducted transparently
on the appropriate public OpenJDK mailing list. All voters cast
their votes on that list, and the individual who calls a vote is
responsible for announcing the result at the end of the specified
voting period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Governing Board will monitor votes to ensure that they
proceed in accordance with these Bylaws. In exceptional
circumstances the Board may invalidate an individual&#8217;s vote,
invalidate the entire vote, or take some other unspecified
action.</p>
<p class="subsection"><a class="title" name="consensus-voting" id="consensus-voting">Consensus voting</a> These methods are used for
decisions that do not require the full attention of the set of
eligible voters.</p>
<p>In the consensus methods the possible votes are Yes, Veto, and
Abstain.</p>
<p>A <a class="def" name="veto" id="veto">Veto</a> must be
accompanied by a justification; a Veto without a justification is
invalid. If&#160;a Veto is raised then the voter who raised the
veto and those who support the proposed action must work together
to reach a mutually-agreeable resolution. If&#160;a Veto is
resolved then the voter who raised the Veto must withdraw that vote
by explicitly abstaining or by casting a Yes vote.</p>
<p>These Bylaws use two methods of consensus voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a class="def" name="lazy-consensus" id="lazy-consensus">Lazy
Consensus</a> &#8212; There are no vetoes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="def" name="three-vote-consensus" id="three-vote-consensus">Three-Vote Consensus</a> &#8212; There are
no vetoes, and at least three Yes votes or else unanimity if there
are fewer than three eligible voters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an optimization, if all eligible voters vote Yes before the
voting period ends then the action is approved at that time.</p>
<p>The <a class="ref" href="#openjdk-lead">OpenJDK Lead</a> may, in
exceptional circumstances, choose to overrule an unresolved Veto;
such a decision may be appealed to the <a class="ref" href="#governing-board">Governing Board</a>.</p>
<p class="subsection"><a class="title" name="majority-voting" id="majority-voting">Majority voting</a> These methods are used for
higher-level decisions in which it is best to have the full
attention of many, if not nearly all, of the eligible voters.</p>
<p>In the majority methods the possible votes are Yes, No, and
Abstain. A No vote is not a veto, it is simply a negative vote. A
No vote may be accompanied by a justification, but that is not
required.</p>
<p>These Bylaws use two basic methods of majority voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a class="def" name="simple-majority" id="simple-majority">Simple Majority</a> &#8212; There are more Yes
votes than No votes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="def" name="two-thirds-majority" id="two-thirds-majority">Two-Thirds Majority</a> &#8212; There are at
least twice as many Yes votes as No votes, and at least three Yes
votes or else unanimity if there are fewer than three eligible
voters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority methods have corresponding though rarely-used
<a class="def" name="absolute" id="absolute">Absolute</a>
variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a class="def" name="absolute-simple-majority" id="absolute-simple-majority">Absolute Simple Majority</a> &#8212;
There are more Yes votes than No votes, and at least half (rounded
up) of all eligible voters vote Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="def" name="absolute-two-thirds-majority" id="absolute-two-thirds-majority">Absolute Two-Thirds Majority</a>
&#8212; There are at least twice as many Yes votes as No votes, and
at least two thirds (rounded up) of all eligible voters vote Yes or
else unanimity if there are fewer than three eligible voters.</p>

not available under such terms, and a contribution is refused
because it violates that specification or fails to pass that test,

<li>Two <a class="ref" href="#at-large-members">At-Large
Members</a>, nominated and elected as described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Governing Board is, in part, a legislative body: It is
empowered to revise these Bylaws to refine existing processes, to
define new processes, and to dispose of processes that are no
longer required. Any revision of these Bylaws must be approved by
an <a class="ref" href="#absolute">Absolute</a> <a class="ref" href="#two-thirds-majority">Two-Thirds Majority</a> of the

<p>The Governing Board is also, in part, a judiciary body: It is
empowered to resolve any procedural disputes which may arise within
the Community. Any procedural decision made by an individual, as
described in these Bylaws, may be appealed to the Governing Board.
If the Governing Board decides to hear an appeal then a proposed
judgement must be approved by a <a class="ref" href="#simple-majority">Simple Majority</a> vote.</p>
<p>The Governing Board is not an executive body: It has no direct
authority over technical or release decisions. That authority is
held, for any given <a class="ref" href="#project">Project</a>, by

and in particular by the <a class="ref" href="#openjdk-lead">OpenJDK Lead</a> for <a class="ref" href="#jdk-release-projects">JDK Release Projects</a>.</p>
<p>The Governing Board is a <a class="ref" href="#group">Group</a>,
with the Chair as its Lead. This allows the Governing Board to
sponsor Projects. The usual rules for dissolving Groups, adding and

a simple majority of its members are present; that is, more members

<p>Votes may also be conducted asynchronously, via e-mail or
similar mechanisms, in which case the voting period shall be seven
calendar days unless otherwise stated in the call for votes, but in
any case not less than 48 hours. In an asynchronous vote a majority
of members must declare themselves present before the end of the
voting period, even if they do not vote. An asynchronous vote is
conducted transparently unless the Governing Board first votes, by

<p>During a two-week nomination period any OpenJDK Member may
nominate an individual who does not currently hold an appointed

nomination period, the new At-Large Members are chosen from the set
of nominees by a vote of all OpenJDK Members.</p>
<ul>

<p>If there are no more nominees than there are open seats then
each nominee must be approved by a <a class="ref" href="#simple-majority">Simple Majority</a> of voting Members. If any
seat remains empty after this process then a new election will be
held to fill it.</p>
