<h1 class="western">Storage Management</h1>
<p>Among the facilities that a Java virtual machine has to provide
is a storage manager. The storage manager is responsible for the
life-cycle of Java objects: allocation of new objects, collection
of unreachable objects, and notifications of unreachability if
requested. A virtual machine can distinguish itself in the
qualities of service the storage manager provides. The HotSpot
virtual machine provides several storage managers, to meet the
needs of different kinds of applications. The two main storage
managers are one to provide short pauses to the application, and
one to provide high throughput.</p>
<h2 class="western">The Klass Hierarchy</h2>
<p>A central data structure of the HotSpot virtual machine is the
&#8220;klass hierarchy&#8221;: the data structure that describes
objects in the managed storage of the virtual machine, and provides
all the operations on those objects. (We use &#8220;klass&#8221;
with a &#8220;k&#8221; because &#8220;class&#8221; is a keyword in
C++ so we couldn't use that.) The klass hierarchy is
self-referential, in that it also contains the descriptions of the
descriptions of objects, and so on. Java objects are not C++
objects, so we can not directly invoke methods on them. But we like
object oriented programming, so the klass hierarchy provides a
mechanism for methods (and virtual methods) on objects.</p>
<p>Perhaps a simple example will suffice. Consider a Java object
instance. The storage for that instance consists of the fields
declared by the Java programmer. In addition to those, we add a
header, the important part of which, for our purposes here, is a
pointer to the representation of the Java class that defined this
instance. The representation of the Java class is itself an object
(but not a Java object; an &#8220;instanceKlass&#8221;), containing
obvious things like the static fields of the class. But in
addition, it includes a description of the types of the fields of
every instance of this Java class, so that the storage manager can
find and adjust reference fields, for example, if it moves objects
in memory. Since the representation of the Java class contains
references to other objects, it must itself have a header with a
pointer to something (another object, also not a Java object; an
&#8220;instanceKlassKlass&#8221;) that describes its fields. This
chain of classes would continue indefinitely if not for the fact
that instanceKlassKlass's are described by klassKlass, which can
describe itself. Perhaps a simple example won't suffice. There are
subclasses of klass for each of the types of object managed by the
storage manager.</p>
<h2 class="western">Allocation</h2>
<p>Most Java applications allocate objects frequently, and abandon
them almost as frequently. So a performant Java virtual machine
should support fast allocation of objects, and be prepared for most
objects to become unreachable fairly quickly. If you look in the
code you will see code that allocates and initializes objects. But
that code is what we call the &#8220;slow-path&#8221; for
allocation, in which a running program calling in the virtual
machine runtimes to allocate an object. Most object allocation is
performed in the &#8220;fast-path&#8221;, which is compiled into
the application, so no calls to the runtime need to be made. In
fact, the fast-path is little more than bumping a pointer and
checking to make sure it hasn't run off the end of an allocation
region. In order to keep that pointer from becoming a scalability
bottleneck, each thread has its own allocation region, and it's own
pointer. These are what we call &#8220;thread-local allocation
buffers&#8221; (TLABs). Each thread can allocate from its TLAB
without coordinating with other threads, except when it needs a new
TLAB. Much work has gone into the sizing of TLABs, and adjusting
their sizes based on the application thread performance, to balance
the number of TLABs needed, the fragmentation lost due to space
held in TLABs by inactive threads, etc.</p>
<h2 class="western">Collection</h2>
<p>Objects eventually become unreferenced, and the storage they
occupy can be reclaimed for use by other objects. The basic
operation of the collector is to traverse the object graph, finding
all the reachable objects and preserving them, while identifying
all the objects that are unreachable and recovering their storage.
It would be prohibitively expensive to traverse the entire object
graph for each collection, so a variety of techniques have been
applied to make collections more efficient.</p>
<h3 class="western">Generations</h3>
<p>We've observed that most Java programs follow the &#8220;weak
generational hypothesis&#8221;: that objects are allocated
frequently, but most are not referenced for long, and that few
references exist between old objects and young objects. To exploit
that, we partition the Java objects into &#8220;generations&#8221;
so that we can apply different algorithms for managing
newly-created objects and objects that objects that have remained
referenced for a while. In the &#8220;young&#8221; generation we
expect there to be a lot of object allocation, but also a high
density of unreachable objects. In the old generation we expect
there not to be a lot of object allocation (in fact the only object
allocation in the old generation is the &#8220;promotion&#8221; of
objects from the young generation by the storage manager, or a few
objects that are allocated directly in the old generation for
special reasons). But once objects in the old generation we expect
them to remain referenced for a while, and so use different
algorithms to manage them.</p>
<h4 class="western">The Young Generation</h4>
<p>The young generation must support fast allocation, but we expect
most of those objects to become unreachable fairly quickly. We
would like not to have to expend any effort on the unreachable
objects, since there are so many of them. So when our young
generations need to be collected, we identify the lreachable
objects in them and copy them out of the young generation. Once
we've copied out the reachable objects, the objects remaining in
the young generation are unreachable, and the space for them can be
recovered without attention to each individual unreachable object.
This operation of copying the reachable objects out of a generation
we call &#8220;scavenging&#8221;, so we often refer to our young
generation collectors as &#8220;scavengers&#8221;. An advantage of
scavenging is that it is fast. A disadvantage is that it requires
room of a second copy of all the reachable objects from the
scavenged generation.</p>
<h5 class="western">Some Ancillary Data Structures</h5>
<p>But wait: how can we identify the reachable objects in the young
generation without traversing the whole object graph, which we said
was expensive? To do that we take advantage of the second part of
the weak generational hypothesis: that there are few references
from old objects to young objects. We keep what is called a
&#8220;remembered set&#8221; of references from the old generation
to the young generation. (Recall that objects only get into the old
generation under the control of the storage manager.) The current
HotSpot collectors use a &#8220;card marking&#8221; remembered set,
which bounds the size of the remembered set at the cost of some
extra work during collections. That extra work comes from the fact
that the remember set is imprecise, so we need to be able to walk
backwards through the old generation looking for the start of
objects. To facilitate that we have a &#8220;block start&#8221;
table (also bounded in size) which you will see if you look in the
code. In addition, the different collectors have some
collector-specific ancillary data structures that will be explained
in more detail later.</p>
<h4 class="western">The Old Generation</h4>
<p>Once objects have been scavenged out of the young generation we
expect them to remain reachable for at least a while, and to
reference and be referenced by other objects that remain reachable.
To collect the space in the old generation we need algorithms that
can't depend on high density of unreachable objects. In particular
we can't count on having enough space to scavenge such objects
somewhere else. Copying objects in the old generation can be
expensive, both because one has to move the objects, and because
one has to update all the references to the object to point to the
new location of the object. On the other hand, copying objects
means that one can accumulate the recovered space into one large
region, from which allocation is faster (which speeds up scavenging
of the young generation), and allows us to return excess storage to
the operating system, which is polite.</p>
<h4 class="western">The Permanent Generation</h4>
<p>In addition to the objects created by the Java application,
there are objects created and used by the HotSpot virtual machine
whose storage it is convenient to have allocated and recovered by
the storage manager. To avoid confusing things, such objects are
allocated in a separate generation, the so-called
&#8220;permanent&#8221; generation. In fact, the objects in it are
not &#8220;permanent&#8221;, but that's what it has been called
historically. For example, information about loaded classes is
stored in the permanent generation, and recovered when those
classes are no longer reachable from the application.</p>
<h5 class="western">Collectors</h5>
<p>In order to provide a variety of qualities of service: e.g.,
short pauses for collection or high throughput for applications
(no, we haven't figured out, yet, how to do both), the HotSpot
virtual machine provides a variety of collectors.</p>
<h6 class="western">The Short Pause Collector</h6>
<p>The short pause collector (also called the
&#8220;low-pause&#8221; collector, or the &#8220;mostly
concurrent&#8221; collector) tries to reduce the interruptions the
application sees due to garbage collection, while providing good
performance recovering storage. Traversing the object graph is
time-consuming, so this collector does almost all the traversal
while the application is running. That's tricky, since the
application is changing the object graph while we are walking it.
Once the reachable objects are identified, the unreachable space is
reclaimed by linking it onto free lists, merging where possible to
avoid fragmentation. By avoiding moving reachable objects, we avoid
the cost of updating references to those objects. That also avoids
the complications that arise if you try to move objects while the
application is using them.</p>
<h6 class="western">The High Throughput Collector</h6>
<p>The point of the high throughput collector (also called the
&#8220;parallel compacting&#8221; collector) is to recover storage
as quickly as possible, using the whole machine if possible, to get
in there, recover storage and get the application running again.
Toward that end, we have designed a parallel compacting collector.
Since most of the work of tracing the object graph is waiting for
the computer's memory system, the high throughput collector spins
up multiple threads to try to hide that latency. The interesting
part of the parallel collector is the way it uses multiple threads
to copy objects, but still ends up with one large, unfragmented
block of free space when it is done.</p>
<h6 class="western">Other Collectors</h6>
<p>We have some other collectors in the code base: a serial
mark-sweep-compacting collector, and parts of other collectors we
were, or are, or will be researching. Those are not as interesting
as the short pause collector or the high throughput collector, but
they are in there, so you will see them if you look at the
code.</p>
<h6 class="western">Collector Styles</h6>
<p>There are two styles in which we've built collectors. At first
we had a framework into which we could plug generations, each of
which would have its own collector. The framework is general enough
for us to have built several collectors on it, and does support a
limited amount of mix-and-matching of &#8220;framework&#8221;
generations. The framework has some inefficiencies due to the
generality at allows. We've worked around some of the
inefficiencies. When we built the high-throughput collector we
decided not to use the framework, but instead designed an interface
that a collector would support, with the high-throughput collector
as an instance of that interface. That means that the
&#8220;interface&#8221; collectors can't be mixed and matched,
which implies some duplication of code. But it has the advantage
that one can work on an &#8220;interface&#8221; collector without
worrying about breaking any of the other collectors.</p>
<h6 class="western">A Parallelization Framework</h6>
<p>In building the parallel collector we built a framework for
parallelizing parts of a collection: work queues, dispatching to
worker threads, etc. We've used that framework to have parts of the
various collectors run in parallel. For example, the young
generation collectors run as multiple threads. The high throughput
collector always runs with multiple threads, and even the short
pause collector can use multiple threads if that won't seriously
degrade the performance of the application.</p>
<h2 class="western">Notification</h2>
<p>A final responsibility of the storage manager is to provide
notifications to the application of objects that have become
unreachable. During the traversal of the object graph, when we find
subclasses of java.lang.ref.Reference (e.g., FinalReference,
WeakReference, SoftReference, or PhantomReference), we don't walk
through those objects, but instead put them on lists to be looked
at later. When the discovery of reachable objects (including
References) is complete, we look at the referents of those
References. Depending on the semantics of the Reference type and
whether the referent is reachable or not, we may queue the
Reference for notification, mark through the referent, or clear the
referent field. This part of the storage manager is an interesting
dance between the virtual machine and the code in the core
libraries for handling References.</p>
