<h1>OpenJDK Governing Board Minutes: 2018/8/23</h1>
<p>The OpenJDK Governing Board met via conference call on Thursday,
23 August 2018 at 15:00 UTC with the following agenda:</p>
<ol>
<li>OCW comments/feedback</li>
<li>OCTLA</li>
<li>100% complete OpenJDK</li>
<li>Any other business</li>
</ol>
<p>Four Board members were present: Georges Saab, Andrew Haley,
Doug Lea, and Mark Reinhold.</p>
<p>One Observer was present: Steve Wallin.</p>
<p>The intent of these minutes is to capture the conversational
flow of the Board's discussion and also to record decisions. If you
are interested only in the latter then search for the word "AGREED"
throughout the text.</p>
<h2>1. OCW comments/feedback</h2>
<p>Georges noted that this was the required quarterly meeting for
calendar Q3 2018.</p>
<p>Moving to the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/workshop">OpenJDK Committers'
Workshop</a>, Georges outlined the Governing Board member's
attendance (Andrew, Mark - all; Georges, Steve - some) and
requested a brief summary. Andrew said that over the two days, it
was clear that there were many important topics to discuss and
misunderstandings to clarify. He observed many informal
conversations in the corridors. Andrew believed that the OCW was
worth doing and appreciated the "unconference" format. Georges
agreed that there were a wealth of good topics. Mark said that the
next OCW would be one or two days attached to <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/">FOSDEM '19</a> (Brussels, 2 &amp; 3 Feb
2019). In response to Doug's request for attendance numbers, Mark
replied that about 80 people registered; however, more than that
showed up and there were a few no-shows. He also said that he
thought it turned out really well and while there were some
disagreements, everybody was constructive and positive. Andrew
noted that there were quite a few people there who had never
committed a patch.</p>
<p>Steve commented that recordings of several OCW talks were
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX8CzqL3ArzXY_9Ornabhxs-j2h4hnvJ3">
available</a> and asked about the status of the others. Georges
replied that the four introductory sessions were recorded and
highly recommended. Mark said that the lack of recordings was
intentional. Recording less formal talks was expected to be of
dubious value and to suppress conversation. Andrew indicated that
some people were hesitant to lead topics. In lieu of recordings,
Mark encouraged those who lead topics to submit summaries to the
<a href="https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/workshop-discuss">workshop-discuss</a>
mailing list. Georges added that the summaries were not expected to
be detailed. He observed that while live discussions were useful,
the OCW was not a forum to make decisions and would not replace
discussions which occur on the mailing lists.</p>
<h2>2. OCTLA</h2>
<p>Steve opened his topic by asking whether the Board viewed the
<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/legal/">OpenJDKCommunity TCK
License Agreement (OCTLA)</a> as an OpenJDK Project activity or an
Oracle activity. He reported that there was an <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/index.html">OpenJDK
page</a> which described the process for accessing the JCK and he
wanted to know whether the Board had insight into the application
and distribution process.</p>
<p>Georges replied that the OCTLA is an Oracle agreement and
information was available on OpenJDK for historical reasons. When
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun
Microsystems</a> created the program in 2007, they wished to
provide the TCK to those who were working on OpenJDK-derived
implementations so that they could verify whether the
implementation was compliant to the Specification. Doug viewed the
fact that the TCK was not part of OpenJDK an oversight. Steve
declared that IBM would like to contribute more to OpenJDK;
however, without access to the OCTLA, their contributions were
restricted.</p>
<h2>3. 100% complete OpenJDK</h2>
<p>Steve asked for the Board's perspective regarding the
expectation that OpenJDK be 100% complete and independent of
external components. In particular, he noted that the TCK was a
dependency requiring a third-party commercial license. Doug agreed
that this was a problem and he would support bring the TCK closer
to OpenJDK if there was any single thing that would accomplish
that. Steve believed that the TCK issue needed to be addressed to
encourage a collaborative environment. Andrew expected that Steve's
difficulty with TCK acquisition was due to being a corporation.
Steve countered claiming that IBM was working on purely OpenJDK
technology.</p>
<p>Andrew said that it was always his understanding that TCK access
was at the good will of Oracle; however, he had not heard of it
being a problem for anybody. Steve asserted that IBM's use was not
any different than other <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/jck-access.html">
OCTLA signatories</a>. Mark disagreed, saying that the situation
was materially different. Further, this had been explained
privately and he didn't believe that a Board meeting was the forum
for further discussion. Doug suggested public contribution of tests
which would become part of the TCK as he did for concurrency. Mark
emphasized that following Doug's advice required contributions.
Steve said that they were working toward and open end-to-end
environment and needed the tests to verify that they had compliant
builds. Georges stated that the OCTLA made it possible for people
doing an OpenJDK-derived implementation to acquire the TCK. Steve
asserted that was what IBM was doing. Georges and Mark both
disagreed. Continuing his comment about the OCTLA, Georges
enumerated the list of 11 <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/jck-access.html">
OCTLA signatories</a> for Java SE 9, or later and began reading the
list of 21 OCTLA signatories for Java SE 8. He stopped reading the
list at Andrew's request.</p>
<p>Doug believed that the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-137188.html">Compatibility
Testing Scholarship Program</a> was still operational and suggested
that IBM consider applying. Steve said that he would need to
investigate and did not understand how IBM's situation was any
different than Red Hat or Azul Systems which did have access to the
TCK. He declared that IBM's implementation was more than 90%
derived from OpenJDK. Georges asked Steve whether he was saying
that IBM's implementation was an OpenJDK derivative. Steve could
not conclusively answer whether or not IBM's implementation is a
derivative of OpenJDK. Steve requested clarification regarding
whether this was at the VM level and received no response.</p>
<h2>4. Any other business</h2>
<p>Andrew reported that the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/groups/vulnerability/">Vulnerability
Group</a> was going well, though there was a small unanticipated
problem. The Group did not see non-security-related patches until
quite late in the release. He assumed that the critical patch
release was the responsibility of the Vulnerability team; however,
that did not appear to be the case. Mark noted that in principle,
non-security patches needed to be handled differently and advised
Andrew to speak to the JDK Updates Project Lead to request earlier
communication of non-security patches. Andrew replied that the
problem had already been discussed in the Group and earlier notice
was expected.</p>
<p>Georges mentioned that he did not have an update on <a href="https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/discuss/2018-July/004801.html">
Project Skara</a> but he expected it to move forward and wanted to
raise awareness. Doug asked whether it was a side project or a
serious contender. Mark replied that it was somewhere in between,
noting that several people were investigating a move to Git and
possibly a hosted provider. He added that there were a number of
technical advantages in moving source to an essentially free
content delivery network and while Git does have flaws, it had come
a long way and was popular. Andrew observed that the potential
issues with something like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
were obvious and he was not particularly happy. Mark said the
source would not be bound to a single provider and another would be
selected if there were problems. He concluded saying that in the
worst case, self-hosting is always possible.</p>
<p>Andrew was perplexed that some people considered tool popularity
to be a draw for developers when working on the JDK requires a
great deal of understanding. Mark agreed saying that it was never a
goal of his, or others in OpenJDK, to maximize the number of
OpenJDK Contributors. The goal is to foster and mentor long-term,
steady Committers.</p>
<p>Andrew recommended Karen Kinnear's <a href="https://youtu.be/-k_IicifbxQ">Just a Small Class File Change --
Nestmates: A Case Study</a> saying it was a fantastic description
of what is actually involved in integrating features into the JDK.
Mark agreed and noted that it was part of the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/jvmlangsummit/">JVM
Language Summit</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, the Board adjourned.</p>
