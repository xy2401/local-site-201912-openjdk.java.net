<h1>OpenJDK Governing Board Minutes: 2017/8/24</h1>
<p>The OpenJDK Governing Board met via conference call on Thursday,
24 August 2017 at 16:00 UTC with the following agenda:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accelerating the JDK release cadence</li>
<li>Infrastructure Update: CSR and Submission Forest</li>
<li>Any other business</li>
</ol>
<p>Five Board members were present: Georges Saab, Andrew Haley
(about 15 minutes late), Doug Lea, John Duimovich, and Mark
Reinhold.</p>
<p>The intent of these minutes is to capture the conversational
flow of the Board's discussion and also to record decisions. If you
are interested only in the latter then search for the word "AGREED"
throughout the text.</p>
<h2>0. Vulnerability Group</h2>
<p>Georges started the meeting by calling attention to the <a href="//mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/discuss/2017-August/004267.html">
Vulnerability Group proposal</a> that Mark sent yesterday. Doug
thought that people seemed happy and were asking good
questions.</p>
<h2>1. Accelerating the JDK release cadence</h2>
<p>Proceeding to the release cadence item, Mark began by saying
that changes to the release cadence had been previously discussed
in various public forums. To begin the discussion in the OpenJDK
Community, Mark was preparing a blog entry (now <a href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/forward-faster">published</a>) for
publication in a week or two. He provided the following
preview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Java SE and the JDK have done reasonably well on a
feature-driven release model for the past 20 years. For Java to
remain competitive, however, it needs to move at a faster pace.
Some may recall that a two-year, time-based model was proposed
several years ago. It was never adopted, however, because
completing key features and addressing security issues was judged
to be more important than maintaining the two-year cadence. Under
the new proposal a major release will ship every six months and can
include any type of feature (language, JVM, and API changes).
Quarterly updates will continue. Every three years the update
release line will be extended to a long-term support release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew said that he could understand selected features and
performance updates every six months, but he questioned whether the
Java SE Specification could be updated at that rate. Mark replied
that updating the Platform Specification was a significant
challenge. However, he noted that Georges and Brian Goetz had spent
eight months (so far) with a subset of the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/home/index">Java Community Process</a> (JCP)
Executive Committee identifying ways to streamline the JCP Process.
Andrew commented that updating the JCP Process to support a faster
release cadence was beyond the limits of what he thought was
possible. Mark answered that the discussed updates to the JCP
Process would allow a JSR to complete in a minimum of 3.5 months,
making a six month release cadence possible. He noted that the JCP
Process was created at a time when development was very
proprietary. The greater transparency of Java SE development in
modern times enables many process optimizations.</p>
<p>Georges observed that releases on a six month cadence would have
significantly less content than those published every two years.
Also, rather than working for months or years on a fully-formed
draft Specification, there would be continuous publication of the
Specification on a regular (weekly or bi-weekly) basis. Mark added
that significant features such as language and VM Specification
changes would be published before the JCP Process for the release
started. When Doug mentioned that a release could be skipped, Mark
agreed that part of the beauty of a six month release cadence was
that skipping a release would be painful but not tragic.</p>
<p>In the context of the OpenJDK Community, Mark described a few
additional changes that were forthcoming. First, long-running
OpenJDK Projects called "JDK" for major releases and "JDK Updates"
for update releases would be introduced. The existence of these
Projects would reduce release start-up costs. Next, "pure" JDK
builds (without Oracle features) would be available. Finally, Java
Flight Recorder (JFR) and other closed or commercial Oracle
features will be open-sourced over the next 1 - 1.5 years.</p>
<p>Andrew steered the conversation to the challenge of dropping
features late in a release. Eclipse could drop a feature 24 hours
before a release since features tended to be isolated. The same was
not true for HotSpot. Mark and Georges both observed that a feature
should not go into a release until the feature was believed to be
complete. Further if the feature conflicts with something, then it
should not go in. John suggested using feature flags to allow a
feature to be added without being enabled. Mark replied that the
technique was regularly used but was not always practical. Georges
said that <a href="//openjdk.java.net/jeps/11">Incubator
Modules</a> was another mechanism that could be used to achieve a
similar goal.</p>
<p>John asked whether it would be possible to have a repository of
patches for minor problems that had been solved. The expectation
was that the repository would eventually be drained. Mark replied
that if somebody had patches for problems they'd like addressed,
they could simply propose and fix them. Mark was skeptical that the
described repository would get very much attention. Doug agreed
saying that he did not have the impression that the described class
of changes were interesting.</p>
<p>Andrew asked how the release repositories would be managed. Mark
said that the initial thought was that the JDK Project main line
would always be open. Three months before a release, a
stabilization branch would be created which would become the major
release. The standard milestones for stabilization would be applied
to the branch.</p>
<h2>2. Infrastructure Update: CSR and Submission Forest</h2>
<p>Mark reminded the Board about the JPRT submission forests which
were announced at FOSDEM. These forests allowed Committers to use
JPRT to build and test their changes to HotSpot for JDK 9. Andrew
Haley and Volker Simonis both provided feedback at that time. The
intent was to make the forests more widely available.
Unfortunately, the JDK 10 equivalent submission forests did not
exist because JPRT has been completely replaced. The submission
system needed to be re-targeted to JDK 10.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to work with others to provide a build and
test system that does not run within a corporate firewall. Doug
thought the ultimate goal was great and suggested speaking to
Google as a further enhancement. Georges remarked that the
technology that Mark referenced was three generations old. The
technology in use is one generation old and the next technology was
under investigation.</p>
<h2>3. Any other business</h2>
<p>No other business was identified.</p>
