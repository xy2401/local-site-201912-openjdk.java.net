<h1>OpenJDK Governing Board Minutes: 2016/10/20</h1>
<p>The OpenJDK Governing Board met via conference call on Thursday,
20 October 2016 at 16:00 UTC with the following agenda:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vulnerability Group (NDA/License)</li>
<li>JDK 9 schedule and Jigsaw issues</li>
<li>Any other business</li>
</ol>
<p>Four Board members were present: Georges Saab, Andrew Haley,
Doug Lea, and Mark Reinhold.</p>
<p>The intent of these minutes is to capture the conversational
flow of the Board's discussion and also to record decisions. If you
are interested only in the latter then search for the word "AGREED"
throughout the text.</p>
<h2>1. Vulnerability Group (NDA/License)</h2>
<p>Georges began the meeting saying that IBM was unable to join,
however quorum was achieved. He was pleased to report that he had
recently received the latest draft NDA/License from Oracle Legal.
It would be sent to Red Hat, IBM and SAP for further evaluation.
After that, the Governing Board (GB) would review the Vulnerability
Group proposal which was expected to include the Group's structure
and communication plan. He reminded GB that the Group required some
private communication, unlike a typical OpenJDK Group.</p>
<p>Andrew asked whether there were objections to adding Azul to the
list of early evaluators. Georges noted that there would be a time
to receive their comments and inquired about the benefit of getting
their feedback early. He added that a larger number of parties
would make it harder to move forward. Doug declared that he did not
want any further impediments. Andrew said that Georges' logic
sounded reasonable and withdrew his suggestion.</p>
<h2>2. JDK 9 schedule and Jigsaw issues</h2>
<p>Andrew started this topic by saying that the JDK 9 schedule and
Jigsaw had big impact on Java and the community. He stated that he
had run many applications on JDK 9 and all had required significant
changes to run. Andrew said that this did not mean that he objected
or did not approve; however, given his expectations for JDK 9
adoptions, he thought it would be unfortunate if the GB did not
think about the impact or deem it worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Doug asserted that he too was worried and expected that Oracle
worried even more. He wished he had a concrete suggestion of what
to do. Andrew continued saying that he expected pushback at
adoption. While realizing that such technical issues were not
within the GB's scope; he wanted to ask Mark if there was a "Plan
B". Mark underscored that this was not a GB issue per se so while a
discussion may be interesting, it was not the right forum. He did
not want the GB minutes to be yet another place where technical
issues and goals were discussed. Andrew confirmed that he was not
proposing to discuss technical issues. Mark affirmed that Oracle
was keenly aware of the fine balance between moving forward and
accommodating all of the past. He stated that there were various
options for "Plan B", which he would rather not discuss in this
meeting. Andrew thought that seemed like a reasonable answer and he
was happy with it. He concluded with a reminder that the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/home/index">JCP</a> would be the final arbiter
and he hoped the "right" thing would happen.</p>
<p>Doug noted that the <a href="//openjdk.java.net/bylaws">Bylaws</a> did not indicate how
transitions across major releases should occur. He reported that
there were people who were frustrated that there was no place to
commit things that were too late for JDK 9. Mark said that
coincidentally, he had a draft of the JDK 10 Project proposal and
planned to send it soon. Georges remarked that he had not seen a
large-scale project that did not have problems with release
transitions. Once work started on the next release, merges with the
older release became an issue. He did not want development to
entirely stop during JDK 9 stabilization. Doug concurred saying
that given the feelings of uncertainty around JDK 9, he did not
want any further delays. Mark's commitment to send out the JDK 10
Project proposal addressed his concerns.</p>
<p>Doug and Andrew's comments about the transition from JDK 9 to
JDK 10 development led Georges to ask whether they were advocating
more frequent major releases as it was something that was being
considered. Andrew shared that Red Hat had a hybrid model with
Fedora releases every 6 months and enterprise releases about as
frequently as the JDK. Doug suggested Ubuntu and their LTS (Long
Term Support) releases as another model. Georges said that these
examples and others were being evaluated. He did not believe that
an existing model could be used directly but there was quite a bit
to learn from them. Mark pointed out that the JCP was another
concern that would need to be considered. Georges mentioned that a
regular year-to-year model had been considered so that every
release would not be a "special snowflake".</p>
<p>Moving back to the concrete, Doug observed that requiring an
always open repository was within the purview of the GB. Georges
suggested proposing a Project so that pushes could occur even if
the release was unknown.</p>
<h2>3. Any other business</h2>
<p>Doug requested status on other miscellaneous processes such as
CCC (for compatibility notifications) and JPRT. Georges replied
that he had a weekly meeting with the team working on them and
expected to see something soon.</p>
<p>At this point, the Board adjourned.</p>
