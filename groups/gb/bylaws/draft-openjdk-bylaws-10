    <p> The OpenJDK Community is structured as a set of <a class="ref" href="#group">Groups</a>, which are collections of individuals who engage in
    open conversation about a common interest, and a set of <a class="ref" href="#project">Projects</a>, which are collaborative efforts to produce
    specific artifacts.  There are Community-wide <a class="ref" href="#general-roles">general roles</a> as well
    as <a class="ref" href="#group-roles">roles specific to Groups</a> and to <a class="ref" href="#project-roles">Projects</a>. </p>

    <p> The <a class="ref" href="#governing-board">Governing Board</a> manages the structure and operation of the
    Community, monitoring its health relative to the principles set forth in
    the Preamble.  It upholds and maintains these Bylaws, resolves procedural
    disputes, and ensures that sufficient infrastructure is available.  The
    Governing Board has no direct authority over technical or release
    decisions. </p>

    <p> A <a class="def" name="participant" id="participant">Participant</a> is an individual who has subscribed to one or
    more OpenJDK mailing lists.  A Participant may post messages to a list,
    submit simple patches, and make other kinds of small contributions. </p>

    <p> A <a class="def" name="contributor" id="contributor">Contributor</a> is a Participant who has signed the <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/oca.pdf">Oracle Contributor Agreement</a>
    (OCA), or who works for an organization that has signed that agreement or
    its equivalent and makes contributions within the scope of that work and
    subject to that agreement.  A Contributor may submit changes larger than a
    simple patch, may propose new <a class="ref" href="#project">Projects</a>, and may take on
    various roles within <a class="ref" href="#group">Groups</a> and Projects. </p>

    <p> If a Contributor&#8217;s employment situation changes such that contributions
    would no longer be covered by the OCA or its equivalent then the
    Contributor must relinquish that role by notifying the <a class="ref" href="#openjdk-lead">OpenJDK
    Lead</a>. </p>

    <p> An <span class="def"><a class="ref" href="#openjdk-member">OpenJDK Member</a></span> is a Contributor who
    has demonstrated a history of significant contributions to the Community as
    recognized by a vote of the existing OpenJDK Members.  An OpenJDK Member
    may propose new Groups, may lead a Group, and is eligible to vote on
    new <a class="ref" href="#project">Projects</a>, new OpenJDK Members, and the selection of
    new <a class="ref" href="#at-large-members">At-Large Members</a> of the <a class="ref" href="#governing-board">Governing Board</a>. </p>

    <p> The <a class="def" name="openjdk-lead" id="openjdk-lead">OpenJDK Lead</a> is an OpenJDK Member, appointed by Oracle,
    who directs the major efforts of the Community, which are new
    implementations of the Java SE Platform known as <a class="ref" href="#jdk-release-projects">JDK Release
    Projects</a>.  The OpenJDK Lead is responsible for the openness and
    transparency of the development process used in those Projects and can also
    settle certain kinds of procedural disputes.  The OpenJDK Lead sits on the

    <p> Many of the actions defined in these Bylaws are approved or ratified by
    a group of individuals using one of the following voting methods. </p>

    <p> For all of the methods: </p>

    <ul>

      <li><p> Votes take place over a period of two weeks, unless otherwise
      specified. </p></li>

      <li><p> Voters may change their votes at any time during a voting period.
      Only a voter&#8217;s most recent vote is counted. </p></li>

      <li><p> The individuals participating in a vote must act in good
      faith. </p></li>

      <li><p> The individual who proposes an action must respond in a timely
      fashion to all questions and objections raised during the voting
      period. </p></li>

      <li><p> Except where noted, all votes are to be conducted transparently
      on the appropriate public OpenJDK mailing list.  All voters cast their
      votes on that list, and the individual who calls a vote is responsible
      for announcing the result at the end of the specified voting
      period. </p></li>

    </ul>

    <p> The Governing Board will monitor votes to ensure that they proceed in
    accordance with these Bylaws.  In exceptional circumstances the Board may
    invalidate an individual&#8217;s vote, invalidate the entire vote, or take some
    other unspecified action. </p>


    <p class="subsection"><a class="title" name="consensus-voting" id="consensus-voting">Consensus voting</a> These methods are used for decisions
    that do not require the full attention of the set of eligible voters. </p>

    <p> In the consensus methods the possible votes are Yes, Veto, and
    Abstain. </p>

    <p> A <a class="def" name="veto" id="veto">Veto</a> must be accompanied by a justification; a Veto
    without a justification is invalid.  If&#160;a Veto is raised then the
    voter who raised the veto and those who support the proposed action must
    work together to reach a mutually-agreeable resolution.  If&#160;a Veto is
    resolved then the voter who raised the Veto must withdraw that vote by
    explicitly abstaining or by casting a Yes vote. </p>

    <p> These Bylaws use two methods of consensus voting: </p>

    <ul>

      <li><p> <a class="def" name="lazy-consensus" id="lazy-consensus">Lazy Consensus</a> &#8212; There are no vetoes. </p></li>

      <li><p> <a class="def" name="three-vote-consensus" id="three-vote-consensus">Three-Vote Consensus</a> &#8212; There are no vetoes, and at
      least three Yes votes or else unanimity if there are fewer than three
      eligible voters. </p></li>

    </ul>

    <p> As an optimization, if all eligible voters vote Yes before the voting
    period ends then the action is approved at that time. </p>

    <p> The <a class="ref" href="#openjdk-lead">OpenJDK Lead</a> may, in exceptional circumstances, choose to
    overrule an unresolved Veto; such a decision may be appealed to the
    <a class="ref" href="#governing-board">Governing Board</a>. </p>


    <p class="subsection"><a class="title" name="majority-voting" id="majority-voting">Majority voting</a> These methods are used for higher-level
    decisions in which it is best to have the full attention of many, if not
    nearly all, of the eligible voters. </p>

    <p> In the majority methods the possible votes are Yes, No, and Abstain.  A
    No vote is not a veto, it is simply a negative vote.  A No vote may be
    accompanied by a justification, but that is not required. </p>

    <p> These Bylaws use two basic methods of majority voting: </p>

    <ul>

      <li><p> <a class="def" name="simple-majority" id="simple-majority">Simple Majority</a> &#8212; There are more Yes votes than No
      votes. </p></li>

      <li><p> <a class="def" name="two-thirds-majority" id="two-thirds-majority">Two-Thirds Majority</a> &#8212; There are at least twice as
      many Yes votes as No votes, and at least three Yes votes or else
      unanimity if there are fewer than three eligible voters. </p></li>

    </ul>

    <p> The majority methods have corresponding though rarely-used
    <a class="def" name="absolute" id="absolute">Absolute</a> variants: </p>

    <ul>

      <li><p> <a class="def" name="absolute-simple-majority" id="absolute-simple-majority">Absolute Simple Majority</a> &#8212; There are more Yes votes
      than No votes, and at least half (rounded up) of all eligible voters vote
      Yes. </p></li>

      <li><p> <a class="def" name="absolute-two-thirds-majority" id="absolute-two-thirds-majority">Absolute Two-Thirds Majority</a> &#8212; There are at least
      twice as many Yes votes as No votes, and at least two thirds (rounded up)
      of all eligible voters vote Yes or else unanimity if there are fewer than
      three eligible voters. </p></li>

    </ul>

    <ul>

      <li> The <a class="def" name="chair" id="chair">Chair</a>, appointed by Oracle; </li>

      <li> Two <a class="ref" href="#at-large-members">At-Large Members</a>, nominated and elected as described
      below. </li>

    </ul>

    <p> The Governing Board is, in part, a legislative body: It is empowered to
    revise these Bylaws to refine existing processes, to define new processes,
    and to dispose of processes that are no longer required.  Any revision of
    these Bylaws must be approved by an <a class="ref" href="#absolute">Absolute</a> <a class="ref" href="#two-thirds-majority">Two-Thirds

    <p> The Governing Board is also, in part, a judiciary body: It is empowered
    to resolve any procedural disputes which may arise within the Community.
    Any procedural decision made by an individual, as described in these
    Bylaws, may be appealed to the Governing Board.  If the Governing Board
    decides to hear an appeal then a proposed judgement must be approved by a
    <a class="ref" href="#simple-majority">Simple Majority</a> vote. </p>

    <p> The Governing Board is not an executive body: It has no direct

    <p> The Governing Board is a <a class="ref" href="#group">Group</a>, with the Chair as its Lead.
    This allows the Governing Board to sponsor Projects.  The usual rules for

    mechanisms, in which case the voting period shall be seven calendar days
    unless otherwise stated in the call for votes, but in any case not less

      <li> Added the ability of Group and Project Leads to delegate authority
      temporarily. </li>

      to say that a simple majority is required. </li>

      <li> Removed the Unanimous Consent voting method.  It was only used for
      selecting new <a class="ref" href="#group-lead">Group Leads</a>, and <a class="ref" href="#three-vote-consensus">Three-Vote
      Consensus</a> is adequate for that case. </li>

      <li> Voters may re-cast their votes at any time. </li>

      <li> Rewrote the <a class="ref" href="#voting">Voting</a> section to clarify the differences between

      text. </li>

      <li> In consensus voting, a resolved Veto must explicitly be
      withdrawn. </li>

      <li> In all types of votes the &#8220;good faith&#8221; requirement applies to all
      those who participate. </li>

      <li> The Governing Board will monitor votes to ensure that they proceed
      in accordance with these Bylaws. </li>

      <li> Rewrote the initial descriptions of OpenJDK Member and <a class="ref" href="#openjdk-lead">OpenJDK
      Lead</a> into proper definitions. </li>

      <li> Expanded the initial <a class="ref" href="#contributor">Contributor</a> and OpenJDK Member
      definitions to mention to say more about what individuals in these roles
      may do. </li>

      extraneous paragraph stating that &#8220;an individual may be nominated to a
      new or newly-empty appointed seat by any Governing Board member, and is
      approved by a <a class="ref" href="#simple-majority">Simple Majority</a> of the Governing Board.&#8221; </li>

      <li> Added a paragraph on the availability of data to the existing
      section on <a class="ref" href="#licenses-trademarks-and-availability-of-data">Licenses and Trademarks</a>. </li>

      <li> Stated explicitly that a Project may have more than one Sponsoring
      Group (this was already implied). </li>

      <li> Stated explicitly that the initial Project Lead of a newly-created
      Project appoints the initial <a class="ref" href="#author">Authors</a>, <a class="ref" href="#committer">Committers</a>, and <a class="ref" href="#reviewer">Reviewers</a> (this
      was already implied). </li>

      <li> Stated explicitly that the initial Group Lead of a newly-created
      Group appoints the initial <a class="ref" href="#group-member">Members</a> (this was
      already implied). </li>

      <li> Clarified the wording about voting upon motions to remove Group
      Members, Committers, Reviewers, and OpenJDK Members to make it clear that
      it is the individual who is the subject of the motion who abstains. </li>

    </ul>

    <p> Version 9, 2011/5/11 </p>

    <ul>

      <li> Clarified the text describing the <a class="ref" href="#availability-of-specifications-and-tests">availability of specifications and

      Classpath Exception and the Assembly Exception as the primary
      license. </li>

    </ul>

    <p> Version 8, 2011/4/15 </p>

    <ul>

      <li> Any revision of the Bylaws must not only be approved by an Absolute
      Two-Thirds Majority of the Governing Board but also then ratified by a

      <li> Specifications and tests should be open-source-licensed, but if not

      resignation or departure. </li>

      <li> Added <a class="ref" href="#reviewer">Project Reviewers</a>. </li>

      <li> Governing Board members must be Contributors, not just Participants,
      because they have write access to the Board&#8217;s web content. </li>

      <li> As Groups, the Governing Board and the OpenJDK Members Group are
      special&#8212;the usual rules for dissolution, adding and removing Group
      Members, and selecting and removing Group Leads do not apply. </li>

      of that Member in the OpenJDK Community database. </li>

      <li> Contributors must resign if they are no longer covered by the OCA or
