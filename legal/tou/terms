<p class="top">You may have rights granted by Oracle or another
party to certain Materials, such as (a) implementation code or
proposed implementation code of a Java platform, under licenses
such as the GPL, the GPL with the Classpath Exception and/or the
OpenJDK Assembly Exception, or the Apache 2.0 license, or (b)
technology specifications under other licenses. However, in

evaluate and comment on the posted Materials on the Site, including
the right and license to modify Materials in the course of such
evaluation and to repost modified Materials to appropriate
locations on the Site as Submissions, subject to the licenses set
forth in Section 4 below.</p>
<h2>4. THINGS YOU SUBMIT TO THE SITE.</h2>
<p class="top">The following terms apply to any Submissions made by
You ("Your Submissions").</p>
<div class="tag">a.</div>
<p>Rights Granted Under the GPL. In addition to any other rights
and licenses you grant in your code Submissions, You also grant all
other Users of this Site the right to use Your code Submissions
under the terms of the GPL, and with the OpenJDK Assembly Exception
and/or the Classpath Exception if such exceptions apply to the
original code. As a special exception, if you have received OpenJDK
Material from Oracle under a license that is not compatible with
the GPL, such as Apache 2.0, or under a license that is in addition
to the GPL, then to the extent your Submissions are a modification
of that Material, you grant all other Users of this Site the right
to use Your code Submissions under the terms of that license. This
does not excuse your obligation to ensure that you comply with all
other obligations to grant licenses for your Submissions as set
forth herein.</p>
<div class="tag">b.</div>
<p>Rights Granted Under Other Open Source Licenses. Certain mailing
lists and portions of the Site may identify additional open source
licenses that will apply to Your code Submissions. Such
identification will be prominent on the relevant portion of the
Site and/or mailing list. With respect to Your code Submissions
made on such mailing lists and portions of the Site, in addition to
any other rights and licenses that you may grant under these Terms
of Use or otherwise (including subsection 4a above), you grant all
other Users of those mailing lists and portions of the Site the
right to use Your code Submissions under the terms of the
identified license. This does not excuse your obligation to ensure
that you comply with all other obligations to grant licenses for
your Submissions as set forth herein. Code received only under the
GPL, for example, must not be posted to a mailing list that
designates BSD as an alternative license.</p>
<div class="tag">c.</div>
<p>Additional Rights Relating to Your Submissions. Whether or not
other agreements relating to Java development ("Other Agreements")
exist between you and Oracle or between you and another
Specification Lead, including, without limitation, the Oracle
Contributor Agreement, you agree that any Submissions you make
available or authorize to be made available on the Site may be
disclosed by Oracle to others for use in evaluating and commenting

them in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or
later developed. This includes, without limitation, the right to
incorporate or implement the Submission into any product or
service, and to display, market, sublicense and distribute the
Submissions as incorporated or embedded in any product or service
distributed or offered by Oracle without compensation to you. All
Users, Oracle, and their sublicensees are responsible for any
modifications they make to the Submissions of others.</p>
<div class="tag">f.</div>
<p>You agree that you will only upload, share, post, publish,
transmit, or otherwise make available ("Share") on or through the

do not post certain Submissions at certain locations on the
Site.</p>
<div class="tag">i.</div>
<p>Relation to Other Java Development Organizations. If a JSR
designates this Site to be used by participants in that JSR then,

Agreement, or other similar terms.</p>

you through or in connection with the Site. Notwithstanding
anything that you may note or state in connection with your
Submissions it shall not be considered confidential information and
shall be received and treated by Oracle on a non-confidential and
unrestricted basis. You agree that, provided Oracle is otherwise in
compliance with the terms of this section, Oracle shall have no
liability for any third party use or misuse of your
Submissions.</p>

assign such rights to Oracle, (ii) waive such rights and (iii)

action against Oracle or Users relative to any such rights in Your

waived by operation of law, You grant to Oracle, a royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license to fully exercise all
such rights akin to ownership, with rights to sublicense through
multiple levels of sublicensees and You further consent to Oracle's
use sufficient to allow Oracle to exercise the rights granted
herein.</p>
